# YOLO-Jetson_Nano

## First step
Install all dependecys to work the model of object detection (Traffic cones). If our dataset is ready, if not were prepare our dataset and train, test and avaluate and look if is good.
## Second step
To make the our cam works detect real time with our model of object detection and mensurate the fps in real time.
